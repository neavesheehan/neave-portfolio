When I started my AI Engineering apprenticeship at Corndel, I inherited a compliance tracking system that lived entirely in Excel. Multiple spreadsheets, manual updates, and a monthly scramble to compile reports for stakeholders.

There had to be a better way.

## The Problem

Our facilities team was managing HVAC compliance across multiple sites. The data existed — temperature logs, maintenance records, testing schedules — but it was scattered across different systems. Every month, someone spent hours copying and pasting data into a master spreadsheet, formatting it, and hoping there were no errors.

**The pain points:**
- Manual data entry (20+ hours per month)
- High risk of human error
- No real-time visibility
- Difficult to spot trends or issues early

## The Solution

I proposed building a Power BI dashboard that would:
1. Pull data automatically from our existing systems
2. Update in real-time
3. Highlight compliance risks immediately
4. Generate reports at the click of a button

The pitch was simple: "Let me spend one month building this, and save us 20 hours every month after that."

## What I Learned

### Start with the end in mind
Before touching Power BI, I sat with the facilities manager and asked: "What decisions do you need to make? What questions do you need answered?" This shaped everything.

### Automate incrementally
I didn't try to automate everything at once. First, I built the dashboard with manual data imports. Then, I automated one data source at a time. Each step showed value and built confidence.

### Design for your audience
Facilities managers don't need fancy visualizations. They need clear, actionable information. Red for overdue, green for compliant, amber for approaching deadlines. Simple works.

## The Impact

Three months in, the dashboard has:
- Eliminated manual monthly reporting
- Caught 3 potential compliance issues early
- Given leadership real-time visibility
- Become the single source of truth for HVAC data

More importantly, it proved that investing time in automation pays dividends. The team now asks: "Can we dashboard that?" instead of reaching for Excel.

## For Anyone Starting Out

If you're building your first dashboard:

1. **Talk to users first** — understand the problem before you start building
2. **Start small** — one data source, one clear question
3. **Make it useful, then make it pretty** — functionality beats aesthetics
4. **Document as you go** — your future self will thank you
5. **Show progress early** — stakeholder buy-in is easier when they see value quickly

Building dashboards isn't just about technical skills. It's about understanding business problems and creating tools that make people's jobs easier.

That's the work I love doing.
