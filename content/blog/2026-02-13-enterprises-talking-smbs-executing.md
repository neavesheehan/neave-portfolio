If you judged AI adoption by LinkedIn posts, you'd assume global enterprises were leading the charge.

But this week's data tells a more interesting story.

Small and mid sized businesses are implementing AI faster than large organisations. Not because they have more budget. Not because they have bigger tech teams.

Because they have fewer layers between idea and action.

Let's unpack what actually happened and why it matters.

## SMBs Are Deploying AI, Not Debating It

Recent industry surveys show that smaller businesses are rolling out AI tools at a higher rate than enterprises.

They're not building custom models. They're using what already exists. Drafting proposals with ChatGPT. Automating invoice categorisation. Summarising client calls. Reducing admin.

They try a tool. If it works, they keep it. If it doesn't, they drop it.

There's no steering committee. No six month pilot. No transformation roadmap.

Just execution.

Why this matters: AI rewards speed and ownership. Small organisations naturally have both.

## Enterprises Are Spending but Moving Slower

Large organisations are increasing AI budgets significantly. But much of that investment is going into infrastructure, consultancy and governance frameworks.

Important? Absolutely.

Immediate operational impact? Not always.

Many enterprises are still preparing for AI rather than embedding it into everyday workflows.

And in some cases, early rollouts are being reassessed due to poor data quality, unclear ownership or over-automation.

That isn't an AI failure.

It's an execution design problem.

Why this matters: Budget doesn't equal progress. Workflow level implementation does.

## The Real Pattern Emerging

The biggest wins this week weren't dramatic transformation announcements.

They were small, contained improvements. Automating one reporting process. Removing one admin bottleneck. Improving one sales workflow.

AI's strongest ROI right now is friction removal.

And friction removal doesn't require a 40 page strategy document.

It requires someone empowered to act.

## 🔥 Hot Take

The companies that win with AI won't be the ones with the most polished AI strategy.

They'll be the ones willing to automate one workflow this month.

Transformation doesn't happen at board level.

It happens in operations.

We're past the "Should we adopt AI?" stage.

The divide now is between organisations that ship improvements and those that pilot indefinitely.

AI rewards decisiveness more than scale.

And small businesses have decisiveness built in.

If you're inside a large organisation, the better question isn't:

"Do we have an AI strategy?"

It's:

"What single workflow could we improve this month?"
