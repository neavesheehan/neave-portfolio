If you've landed here, you're probably wondering who I am and why I've decided to add another voice to the internet. Fair question.

## What I Do

I'm an AI Engineer apprentice at Corndel, which sounds fancier than it feels most days!

In reality, I spend my time building dashboards that turn compliance chaos into something stakeholders can actually use. Think HVAC systems, water safety tracking, fire compliance—not the sexiest topics, but the impact is real!

My job is to take messy, scattered data and transform it into clean, decision-ready insights. Then I automate the boring bits so teams can spend less time wrestling with spreadsheets and more time actually solving problems.

That's how I think about my approach. **Professional, polished and credible—but still clearly me.**

I'm not interested in being another corporate robot spouting buzzwords. I care about building things that work, communicating clearly, and being honest about what I'm learning along the way.

## Why This Blog Exists

I wanted a space to share what I'm building and learning. Somewhere between LinkedIn professional and "actually a human being who finds this stuff genuinely interesting."

**You'll find:**

- Real project stories with lessons learned (including the mistakes)
- Dashboard design tips that actually work in the real world
- What's new in AI this week—curated, not hyped
- Power BI tricks I wish I'd known sooner
- Career reflections from someone figuring it out in real time

This isn't a blog full of theory or recycled advice. It's what I'm actually doing, what's working, and what isn't.

## What to Expect

I'll be posting regularly—stories from projects, tips from the trenches, and a weekly look at AI developments that actually matter.

**No fluff, no jargon, just practical insights** from someone who's building solutions and learning every day.

I also send out a newsletter twice a week briefing what has been covered on my blog!

## Let's Connect!

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neave-sheehan-4b374936a) or just reply to the newsletter when you get one.

Looking forward to sharing this journey with you,

**Neave** :)
