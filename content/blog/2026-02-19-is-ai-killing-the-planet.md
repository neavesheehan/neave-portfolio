A Future Homesteader's Honest Take

It always feels like a juxtaposition.

Me, someone whose dream is to have her own little farm, grow food properly, maybe keep a couple of Highland cows, also being deeply invested in artificial intelligence.

So today we're asking the uncomfortable question:

Is AI killing our planet?

And more importantly… if it is, what are we going to do about it?

Because I don't want to build a career in something that quietly makes the world worse.

## The Reality: AI Uses Energy

Let's not pretend otherwise.

AI runs on data centres. Data centres use electricity. They need cooling. They require land, infrastructure, and specialised chips. Training large models consumes serious compute power.

That's real.

And as AI demand grows, infrastructure is expanding quickly. The industry is investing billions because it expects usage to explode.

Energy demand will rise. There's no point sugarcoating that.

But this is where nuance matters.

## The Question Nobody Asks

The conversation usually stops at: "AI uses a lot of energy."

Okay.

Compared to what?

Compared to inefficient supply chains. Compared to office buildings running 24/7. Compared to commuting five days a week. Compared to global food waste. Compared to outdated grid systems.

If AI is deployed to optimise logistics, reduce overproduction, improve renewable forecasting, and eliminate waste heavy admin systems, the net effect could be positive.

Technology itself isn't the villain. Bad implementation is.

## What Is Actually Changing

There is a quiet shift happening behind the scenes.

Major AI infrastructure providers are investing heavily in renewable powered data centres. Cooling systems are becoming more efficient. Chip design is improving. Model architectures are being refined to require less compute.

There's a commercial incentive to make AI more efficient. Compute is expensive. Energy is expensive. Waste costs money.

Efficiency is not just ethical. It's profitable.

And that's why I'm cautiously optimistic.

## Where We Need to Be Honest

Here's the part I won't ignore:

If AI growth outpaces renewable adoption and efficiency gains, emissions will rise.

If we chase "bigger models" purely for dominance, without considering cost or sustainability, we will create unnecessary strain.

So the real work isn't stopping AI.

It's building standards around:

* Renewable infrastructure
* Transparent reporting
* Smarter model design instead of endless scale

That's a policy and engineering conversation- not a panic one.

## 🔥 Hot Take

AI is not the environmental villain.

Overconsumption is.

We live in a world that mass produces fast fashion, wastes a third of its food, builds inefficient systems, and flies people across countries for meetings that could be virtual.

But somehow, servers get all the outrage.

If AI reduces physical waste, optimises energy systems, and eliminates inefficiencies at scale, it could become one of the most powerful environmental tools we have.

The danger isn't AI.

The danger is building it irresponsibly.

## So Where Do I Stand?

I do not want AI to harm the planet.

Full stop.

If I ever felt like this industry was moving recklessly without regard for environmental impact, I wouldn't be comfortable championing it.

But right now, what I see is an industry racing not only for capability, but for efficiency.

And the people who care about sustainability should be involved in AI. Not standing outside criticising it.

Because if we want smarter systems, lower waste, and better resource management…

We need the right people shaping the tools.

Maybe wanting a homestead and building AI aren't opposites after all.

Maybe both are about the same thing:

Reducing waste. Building smarter systems. Living more intentionally.
