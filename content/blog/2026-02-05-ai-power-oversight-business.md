If you gave an AI powered model parenting instructions, would you allow it to raise your kids unsupervised?

If you owned an AI powered car, would you write one prompt and then blindly trust it to get you from A to B?

Or would you watch how it behaves, check that it's following instructions, and re evaluate the boundaries you've set when it gets something wrong?

Of course you would.

So why, when it comes to your business, do so many teams give AI so much authority with so little visibility or human oversight?

This is why AI adoption is failing in most organisations.

## The problem isn't ambition. It's abdication.

Most AI failures don't come from doing too little.

They come from doing too much, too fast and then stepping away.

A tool gets rolled out. A workflow gets automated. A model gets access to real business data.

And then ownership quietly disappears.

No one can clearly answer:

* Who is accountable for the output
* Who reviews decisions before they land
* What happens when the system behaves unexpectedly

Instead, AI is treated like infrastructure: switched on and assumed to be stable.

But AI isn't static. Its behaviour changes with data, prompts, context, and usage. Leaving it unattended isn't efficiency.

It's abdication.

## Trusting AI is not the same as understanding it

A lot of organisations say they "trust" their AI systems.

What they usually mean is that they've stopped looking closely.

Trust without understanding isn't maturity. It's fatigue.

Real trust comes from being able to explain:

* What the system is allowed to do
* What it is explicitly not allowed to do
* Where its outputs feed into human decisions
* How errors are caught before they compound

If you can't explain those things clearly, the problem isn't the AI.

It's the lack of ownership around it.

## Oversight isn't anti AI. It's how AI actually scales.

There's a persistent myth that oversight slows AI down.

In reality, it's what makes AI usable at scale.

The teams getting real value from AI aren't the ones shouting about being "AI powered".

They're the ones quietly:

* Defining decision boundaries
* Separating recommendations from execution
* Treating AI outputs as inputs, not answers

They assume mistakes will happen. They expect drift. They build feedback loops early.

Because the real risk isn't that AI gets something wrong once.

It's that it gets something wrong quietly, repeatedly, and at scale.

## 🔥 Hot Take

Most AI failures aren't caused by bad models. They're caused by organisations trying to outsource responsibility.

AI didn't decide to automate that process. A human did.

AI didn't remove the review step. A human did.

AI didn't assume it was "good enough" to run unattended. Leadership did.

When something goes wrong, we blame the technology.

But the uncomfortable truth is this: AI is usually doing exactly what we told it to do, just at a scale we weren't prepared to own.

Until businesses are willing to take responsibility for how AI is scoped, monitored, and corrected, adoption will keep failing.

Not loudly. Quietly. And expensively.
